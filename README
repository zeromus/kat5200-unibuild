Compiling under Visual Studo 2008 Express
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*  Download source for the guichan, sqlite, zlib, SDL, and SDL_image libraries
*  Unpack the visualc++ files from the SDL source
*  Edit the file kat5200.vsprops to point to the correct relative directories 
     for the guichan, sqlite3, zlib, SDL, and SDL_image libraries.
*  Edit the file kat5200.sln so it points to the correct location for the 
     SDL.vcproj and SDLmain.vcproj files in the SDL source
*  To compile SDL, you need the Direct X SDK, download and install from 
     Microsoft
*  Start Visual C++ and open kat5200.sln
*  Under Tools->Options->Projects and Solutions->VC++ Directories:
     - Under Include, add the directory for the Direct X SDK Include files
     - Under Library Files, add the directory for the Direct X SDK Library 
        files
*  Build Solution
*  Compile kat5200.iss with INNO setup to obtain the Installer

Compiling under Unix
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*  To compile, the user must have zlib ,libSDL, libSDL_image, and libguichan 
   and their respective development libraries (-dev packages) installed. 
*  Since libguichan versions are generally not compatiblity with each other 
   yet, you may need to download the source and compile it as well. 
*  Compile and make kat5200 as follows (must have root privilages):

# tar xvzf kat5200-x.x.x.tar.gz
# cd kat5200-x.x.x
# ./configure
# make
# make install 

* On debian based systems such as Ubuntu, adding the option to 'configure' 
  '--prefix=/usr is probably desired.
* Note that on many systems, instead of performing 'make install' the 
  preferred way is to perform 'checkinstall' to automatically create and 
  install a package.

Building the database (src/sql directory)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*  Download TOSEC dat files for the Atari 5200 and Atari 8-bit
*  Use provided dat2sql to transform all dat files to sql files
*  Use sqlite executable (download seperately) and create kat5200.db3
*  Read Schema.sql into the database
*  Read all other sql files into the database
